        <p> I Like to play Chess because it's an indoor game, so you can play it any time of the year, any time of day and it is a recreational and competitive board game played between two players where you can have fun with friends who are beginners and also friends that really know how to play. The better you get at chess, the more and more fun it is!When I get free I definately play with my parents and also with my and sister.Chess increases your intelligence,and helps you focus and that is why I love this game!</p>
